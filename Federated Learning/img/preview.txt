In scenarios where data privacy is paramount and bandwidth is limited, the concept of federated learning emerges as a vital approach. Federated learning allows multiple decentralized entities—such as different households in the case of electricity consumption—to collaboratively learn a predictive model while keeping all training data local. This method avoids the need to transfer large volumes of sensitive data to a central server, addressing significant privacy concerns.
