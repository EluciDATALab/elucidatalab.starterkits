    "### Business context\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red;\">*I would start here with a bit more context, explaining that you want to forecast electricity consumption but that that is difficult given the heterogenity of households and patterns. Only then describe it as concept drift, to make it a bit more tangible for readers.*</span>\n",
    "In an increasingly connected world, the concept of federated learning is becoming crucial, especially in scenarios where data privacy is paramount, and bandwidth is a limiting factor. Federated learning enables multiple decentralized devices or servers (clients) to collaboratively learn a predictive model while keeping all training data local. This avoids the need to transfer large volumes of sensitive data to a central server for processing. However, federated learning environments face significant challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Dynamic and heterogeneous data sources often lead to concept drift, where the underlying data patterns the model has learned change over time, potentially degrading the model's performance.\n",
    " - Limited bandwidth for communication between clients and the central server can hinder the efficiency of model updates and retraining processes.\n",
    " - Privacy concerns limit the amount and type of data that can be shared between clients, complicating the detection and mitigation of concept drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "These challenges necessitate advanced strategies for model training and maintenance to ensure that predictive models remain accurate and efficient over time without compromising privacy or incurring prohibitive communication costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business goal\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red;\">*The same here.*</span>\n",
    "The business goal for this Starter Kit is **concept drift mitigation** in federated learning environments. Specifically, this Starter Kit applies a methodology called *FedRepo*, introduced by Tsiporkova et al. [1], that manages a dynamic repository of federated models to effectively cope with concept drift. The FedRepo methodology aims to provide a robust solution that maintains the accuracy and efficiency of the federated models over time, ensuring they adapt to changes in data dynamics while minimizing communication overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application Context\n",
    "The FedRepo methodology is applicable in various settings where data privacy and limited connectivity are major concerns:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Healthcare: Hospitals and medical institutions can collaborate on developing predictive models or improving diagnostic tools <span style=\"color:red;\">on more diverse data</span> without actually sharing patient data. \n",
    " - Wearables: User experience of several features (e.g. text prediction) can be enhanced on personal devices without compromising privacy.\n",
    " - Industrial: Assets manufactured by a third party (e.g. printers) can be used to collaborately learn predictive models without each customer having to share its data. <span style=\"color:red;\">*I don't understand this one. The space here is not as limited as in the paper, so another sentence doesn't hurt.*</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starter Kit outline\n",
    "This Starter Kit will demonstrate the application of the FedRepo methodology using a real-world dataset. First, the dataset will be described, which contains electricity consumption data of UK households. Then, the FedRepo methodology will be explained and discussed through its key steps, while applying them on a subset of the households. For a <span style=\"color:red;\">more in-depth</span> explanation of all steps involved, please refer to the paper. Finally, the performance of the methodology is evaluated, also in terms of its adaptability and concept drift mitigation."

    "6. *Federated Cluster Models Construction*: For each cluster $k$, a federated RF model $Φ_{k}$ is built following the same procedure described in step 3. The trees contributed by all workers in cluster $k$, i.e., the trees contained in the respective $Γ_{i}$ for each worker $i$ in the cluster, are pooled together and reshuffled. Subsequently, 100 trees are randomly sampled to create the federated RF model $Φ_{k}$. This model is associated with an initial support score $s_{k}$ which reflects the relative size of the cluster.

    "### Concept drift mitigation\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of naively applying the initial cluster models without modification, FedRepo proposes a framework to perform dynamic maintenance to mitigate concept drift. The basis of this framework is to calculate the RMSE score between the predicted and observed values after each day. This score is compared to a threshold $δ$, that is derived from the model’s performance on the worker's test set. If the RMSE score is above the threshold for three days in a row, the following steps are conducted:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Global Model Activation*: The overall federated global model $Φ_{0}$ is activated for the worker in question, i.e., the worker is added to $Θ$ and the support of $Φ_{0}$ is updated accordingly, i.e., $s_{0} = s_{0} + 1/300$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Model Parameter Update*: The parameters of the corresponding (cluster) federated model ($Φ_{k}, Θ_{k}, s_{k}$) are updated, i.e., the worker is removed from the list of workers that use this model and the model support is reduced accordingly such that $s_{k} = s_{k} − 1/M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept drift in the consumption pattern of a worker thus is identified by monitoring the performance of its cluster model. If this performance drops (increasing error score) for a sufficiently long period (3 days), the cluster model is deactivated for this worker and the global model is put as replacement. The global model acts as a baseline, one-fits-all model that is assumed to mitigate the effects of concept drift for a worker that no longer fits its customized model. Each time the global model is activated for a worker, some maintenance checks need to be executed. These involve the identification of cluster models of which the support has dropped too low and verify whether a retraining is needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Workers’ Repository*: For each federated cluster model $k$, if its support $s_{k}$ is smaller than a predefined threshold $z$, its workers are added to the workers’ repository $Θ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Cluster Model Deactivation*: The federated cluster model $Φ_{k}$ is deactivated by resetting its support $s_{k} = 0$. The overall federated global model $Φ_{0}$ is activated for the remaining workers that still used the deactivated model and the support of $Φ_{0}$ is updated accordingly, i.e., $s_{0} = s_{0}$ +  # $Θ_{k}/M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Federated Models’ Repository*: If the support $s_{0}$ of the overall federated global model $Φ_{0}$ is above the predefined threshold $Δ$, retraining is performed with the workers in $Θ$. Local models are trained on the previous three months and new trees are sent to the tree repositories of the respective workers to replace the previously contributed trees. The global model is updated by sampling random trees from the update tree repositories and clustering is performed in the same way as before. New cluster models are added to the repository of federated models, causing every worker to again have an active cluster model and resetting the support of the global model to 0. Note that for the workers not present in $Θ$ before retraining and therefore still have an active cluster model, nothing has changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this data, a cluster model is said to have too low support when it drops below 10 workers, i.e. $z = 0.033$, and retraining is invoked when the workers' repository surpasses 60 workers, i.e. $Δ = 0.2$.

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The above introduced FL method has several advantages for tackling distributed concept drift. First of all, the concept drift detection comes with a very small overhead, as during the regular inference phase not only the actual forecast values are calculated, but additionally the residuals. Based on the residuals, the concept drift is detected locally, while the repositories are updated in the central node. Furthermore, the concept drift is not assumed to happen at the same time across different workers. Instead, each worker can be part of a shared repository built on information from similar devices or activate the federated global model in case its performance is degrading before being assigned to a new repository. Third, the number of models is not predefined and constant, as the binary PSO allows a flexible number of clusters. With this, any flexible change in behaviour is captured. Finally, as the worker clustering is performed on the model performance only, it is not necessary to share the actual patterns of the workers’ data with the central node."
