    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-series are characterised as a collection of data points obtained at successive times, most often with equal intervals between them. Since an increasing amount of assets is instrumented with sensors (e.g. machines, wearables), this type of data is omnipresent. Depending on the application domain, time-series data is exploited for various purposes, e.g. profiling energy consumption of households, predicting imminent failures of a production line, estimating the remaining useful lifetime of a machine, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, time-series data cannot be used easily as-is by machine learning algorithms. This can be, for example, due to data quality issues such as missing values and sensor misreadings, or because some algorithms are not fit to deal with the continuous nature of this type of data or the associated (often high) frequency with which it is gathered.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this Starter Kit is to present a number of typical **time-series preprocessing methods**. You will learn how these can be used to improve the quality of the dataset and to prepare it for further exploration, analysis and modelling purposes. This is a crucial step, as it will improve the completeness, reliability and accuracy of your results.\n",

Play with the two inputs and see how the level of detail of the timeseries changes and how that influences the insights that you can derive from it.\n",

You can observe that the visualization of the temperature shows a seasonal pattern in the data, even though it contains quite some noise. The visualization of the wind speed is not at all interpretable due to this noise. \n",

You can notably observe the strict correlation between the patterns of wind speed and power.  Note also that increasing the resampling of the time-series too much will discard most of the information it contains.\n",

For the wind speed and temperature data in our example, we can opt to aggregate the data using the median of the values within the selected period. This statistic is more robust against outliers (e.g. due to sensor misreadings) that could be present in our dataset. For other quantities, we might consider other statistics. For example, if we were considering energy production, it makes more sense to sum all the data samples rather than to average them. \n",

Typically, this is the mean or the median. This has the effect of reducing short-term fluctuations while preserving long-term trends. \n",
    "- **Gaussian smoothing**: this method summarizes the values over a sliding window using a Gaussian function. The size of the sliding window is specified by the standard deviation of this Gaussian function, called the *kernel*. With this method, the values closest to the center of the sliding window will have a stronger impact on the smoothing. The impact of the remaining values is a function of the distance to the window center.\n",

For a given attribute, this method computes its interquartile range (IQR), which is the difference between the $25^{th}$ and $75^{th}$ percentiles. This value is then multiplied by a constant factor $\\alpha$ which determines how stringent the outlier detection is. A typical value for $\\alpha$ is 1.5, although this value can be adapted according to the level of stringiness desired - indeed, larger values will push the outlier boundaries further (thereby reducing the number of detected outliers). The resulting value is subtracted from the $25^{th}$ and added to the $75^{th}$ percentiles to obtain the lower and upper fences, respectively, which define the thresholds beyond which a given value is labeled as an outlier."

    "For detecting outliers of the power attribute, we will use an alternative to the approach taken for temperature, even though in principle we could take the same approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "The approach we will use is based on exploiting the fleet aspect. At each point in time, we compute the median power recorded by the fleet and we consider any value that deviates _too much_ from that median value to be an outlier. In order to determine what constitutes _too much deviation_, we again consider the boxplot outlier definition. If a value is beyond 5 times the IQR from the $25^{th}$ or $75^{th}$ percentile, we consider the observation to be an outlier. \n",
    "To exclude periods when all the turbines in the fleet were not operational, we only consider time points when at least 3 of the 4 turbines recorded a power production above 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below allows you to explore all the detected outliers in the power attribute using this definition. You can change the Flank amount parameter in order to see a larger time window around the outlier."

    "It can be observed that the outliers often happen in periods of time when the power of a given turbine dropped to 0 without it being the case for the remaining turbines. There are, nonetheless, other instances, when the produced power power of a given turbine was (statistically speaking) above what would be expected given the behavior of the remaining turbines.\n",

    "## Data Imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world industrial datasets often suffer from missing data due to several reasons, e.g. sensor malfunctioning or communication errors. In addition, if we have removed outliers, these will also show up as missing values in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, we can fill the missing values using imputation techniques. Multiple techniques exist and which one to choose depends on the data characteristics, e.g. presence of trends, the length of the missing period, etc. In the next sections, we will use 3 different imputation techniques:\n",

    "- Fleet-based interpolation\n",
    "- Pattern-based imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the efficiency of the different methods, we will create a set of synthetic missing data events with varying durations. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows us to compare the outcome of the imputation procedure with the _real_, _observed_ values. "

    "### Linear interpolation and fleet median\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear interpolation** is a simple technique that is frequently used in case a small number of points are missing within a particular time period. It simply connects the last point before and the first point after the missing data episode with a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fleet median**, on the other hand, exploits the fleet-based aspect of our asset for imputing periods of missing data. For the dataset under investigation, we know the assets are co-located and are, therefore, exposed to similar conditions (e.g. wind direction and speed). Hence, we can compute the median value of the wind speed for the turbines that do have data and use those values as an estimation of the missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "While linear interpolation is sensitive to the event duration (the longer the event, the less likely a linear interpolation will follow the _real_ values), fleet median interpolation may result in unexpected results if there are too few assets in the fleet (or too few assets with non-missing values at the time). The latter method is, furthermore, dependent on the different assets being co-located and exposed to similar conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the plot below you can see how this method performs for missing data events of different durations. You can also change the number of turbines that are considered for the fleet median interpolation and see how that affects the accuracy of the prediction. In our dataset there are 4 turbines available, so you can choose between 1 and 3 turbines to use for the fleet median interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The red trace corresponds to actual observed values (remember that we are dealing with _synthetic_ missing data events) and, thus, the closer the blue (linear interpolation) and green (fleet mean) lines are from the red line, the better the interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to experiment with different values, and note how the performance of the linear interpolation degrades with increasing event size and how the performance of the fleet median interpolation is dependent on a decent number of assets considered. Remember that the data is sampled at 10-minute intervals when considering the event duration."

    "### Pattern-based interpolation \n",
    "\n",
    "When linear interpolation or fleet-based data imputation techniques cannot be used, we can still use pattern-based imputation provided the time-series follow a predictable pattern. In this section we illustrate this method on two attributes, namely the time-series for temperature and wind speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pattern-based interpolation performs well on signals that follow a _predictable_ pattern, as is the case for signals that show a strong seasonal modulation. You can appreciate this by comparing the interpolation of the temperature and wind speed signals. The former, as we have seen before, follows a daily pattern (night vs. day) and a seasonal pattern (winter vs. summer) and shows a high-quality interpolation. The latter, however, has a weaker seasonal modulation reflected in a less accurate interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use seasonal ARIMA, an extension of the ARIMA model, for forecasting seasonal time-series data. More specifically, in our case we can use seasonal ARIMA for forecasting the evolution of the temperature based on the data coming from a single asset. The interested reader can find more information about the Seasonal ARIMA in following this [tutorial](https://otexts.org/fpp2/seasonal-arima.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how varying the duration of the missing data event affects the interpolation quality. You can also anticipate the start of the (synthetic) missing data event and see if that affects the prediction. Try to shift it by 36 hours. Notice how the prediction fails to mimic the original values in the beginning. Indeed, this type of interpolation might be sensitive to the starting point for the forecasting. Here we used one year of data prior to the missing data event for the training of the ARIMA model. Using a longer period (including multiple seasonal patterns), nonetheless will improve the forecasting and avoid the aforementioned shortcomings."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Starter Kit, we have demonstrated techniques that can be used to preprocess time-series data in order to improve its quality for further exploitation. We have used a real-world dataset containing wind turbine data that exhibits the typical characteristics of industrial datasets, i.e. it contains noise, outliers, missing values and seasonal patterns. In particular, we have illustrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "* how resampling and smoothing can be applied to better understand the behaviour of the time-series;\n",
    "* how the quality of the data can be improved through normalization and outlier detection;\n",
    "* how missing data can be imputed via 3 different imputation techniques: linear interpolation, fleet-based imputation and pattern-based interpolation, and outlined what are the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of these methods allows to improve the quality of the data and to prepare it for further exploration, analysis and modelling purposes. This is a crucial step, as it will improve the completeness and reliability of the input data, and consequently the accuracy of your results."
